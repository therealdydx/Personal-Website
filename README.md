# Welcome


### Hi there 👋

I'm an undergraduate from 🇸🇬 Singapore, currently studying at Yale-NUS College, intending to major in either Mathematical and Computational Sciences, Economics, or Psychology. I have about a year of experience in coding, and have dabbled with various things, from making frontends, to data analysis, to hackathons. 

I'm really interested in technology, social impact and start-ups and I'm looking forward to creating great products.

Outside of projects, I also work as a venture analyst with Protégé Ventures and TRIVE (Venture Capital), handling deal sourcing for startups, doing industry research and coming up with theses for possible investment sectors. I also help run some events and projects for the Yale-NUS Entrepreneurship Society and the NUS Technopreneurship Society. 

Outside of work related stuff, I play with Yale-NUS Floorball, play the piano on my own and study languages. Also I watch some chinese and korean entertainment from time to time :D
